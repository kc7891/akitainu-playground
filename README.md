## Akitainu Example

This repository is an example setup of [akitainu](https://github.com/uhyo/akitainu/tree/master). **Feel free to try akitainu by sending a pull request to this repository!**

This repository has a standard ESLint configuration. Also, **akitainu** is set up so that changed files in PRs are checked with additional rule `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`. Existing files (namely `src/any-paradise.ts`) does not trigger the rule (as long as that file is not changed).

Check [pull requests](https://github.com/uhyo/akitainu-playground/pulls) to see how akitainu works.
